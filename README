A program that encrypts bodies of text by incrementally rotating the characters in relation to a user-defined key.
Can also decrypt, and do both operations at various levels of depth! (for instance, you can encrypt some text
using several encryption keys, used in a certain order).

Currently implemented:
 - Encryption/decryption functionality

Next:
 - Load/save functionality
 - New file functionality
